# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
### `Auto Edit` (Global Offset)

The Edit Program page includes an Auto Edit feature to quickly offset taught positions based on measured and desired diameters.

- Open the editor and press the `Auto Edit` button.
- Enter the current diameter and desired diameter. Tap a field to use the on-screen NumericKeypad.
- Confirm to apply a global offset: `delta = desired - current`.
- The offset updates the active axis positions for each step (based on the step pattern and side), while skipping any `Repeat` steps (pattern 5).
- Values are rounded to 3 decimals and only numeric fields are modified.

Notes:
- Right side updates `axis1Cmd` and/or `axis2Cmd` for active axes.
- Left side updates `axis3Cmd`/`axis4Cmd` when present, otherwise `axis1Cmd`/`axis2Cmd`.
- Repeat steps (pattern 5) are not altered.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
